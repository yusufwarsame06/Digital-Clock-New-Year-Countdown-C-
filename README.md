# Digital-Clock-New-Year-Countdown-C-
This project is a terminal-based digital clock written in C that displays the current local time in real time. The program continuously updates the clock using system time functions and formats the output to resemble a digital clock display.

A special feature of this project is a built-in New Year trigger: when the system time reaches 12:00 AM on January 1st, the program automatically prints a celebratory “HAPPY NEW YEAR” message to the terminal.

Key Features:

Real-time clock display using system time

Continuous screen updates using loops

Conditional logic to detect a specific date and time

Cleanly formatted terminal output

Concepts Used:

time.h and system time functions

Loops and conditional statements

Formatted output (printf)

Program flow control

This project demonstrates time handling, logic control, and real-time output in a low-level language.
